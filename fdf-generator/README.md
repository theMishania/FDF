# fdf-generator
Convert a BMP image into a fdf file

Feel free to edit the script, it currently only works for bitmap images smaller than 255 * 255, because I don't really know how to reliably get the width of the image in the header.

To run the script, simply type :
```
python main.py your_file.bmp
```
